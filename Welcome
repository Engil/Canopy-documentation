title: Canopy - A git-blogging unikernel ðŸŒ¿
author: Canopy's author

Canopy is an attempt at writting a blog-engine based on Git using [MirageOS][mirage].

The goal is to provide a simple blog platform that only requires you to provide a Git remote URL and respecting some architecture rules within the said repository.

Canopy is written in OCaml using MirageOS and [Irmin][irmin], but it is currently only available on the Unix platform. The Xen platform will be supported as soon as [Decompress][decompress] is ready to be used in Irmin.
